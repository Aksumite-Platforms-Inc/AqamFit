// The RouterScope.override is a bit of a hack for testing.
// A more robust solution for testing navigation:
// 1. Use the `go_router_testing` package's `FakeGoRouter`.
// 2. Configure `MaterialApp.router` with a `routerDelegate` and `routeInformationParser`
//    from a GoRouter instance that has a `navigatorObserver`. Then, assert on the observer's history.

// For `didPopRoute()`: It triggers `WillPopScope`. If `onWillPop` returns `true`,
// the route is popped. If `false`, it's not.
// The test for "Exit" button checks that the dialog disappears. The `onWillPop`
// in `OnboardingScreen` is designed to return `true` when "Exit" is pressed.
// The actual app exit is a system-level behavior.
//
// The `RouterScope.override` allows `GoRouter.of(context)` to find our mock.
// If `context.go()` is an extension method, it might internally call `GoRouter.of(context).go()`.
// If `GoRouter.of(context)` is not found, `context.go()` might fail.
// The Builder widget inside MaterialApp ensures `context` has `MaterialApp` and `RouterScope` ancestors.

// A note on `CupertinoIcons`: if tests fail to find these, ensure that the assets/fonts for Cupertino icons
// are correctly loaded by the test environment. `flutter_test` should handle this by default.
// If `OnboardingPage` model was also mocked, icon finding would be different.
// Here, we use the real `OnboardingPage` data from the screen.

// Final check on `RouterScope.override`:
// It is indeed a valid way to provide a specific GoRouter instance down the tree for testing purposes.
// The key is that `GoRouter.of(context)` will pick up this overridden instance.
// The `configuration` and `state` for `RouterScope.override` should be representative of the route being tested.
// Here, path `/` is a placeholder for the root where OnboardingScreen is presumably shown.
// If OnboardingScreen is shown at a different path like `/onboarding`, that should be reflected.
// For this test, assuming OnboardingScreen is effectively at the root of this test's MaterialApp.
// The `RouterScope.override` should be inside the `MaterialApp` if `OnboardingScreen` itself doesn't build one.
// The current setup with `MaterialApp(home: Builder(... RouterScope.override ... OnboardingScreen))` is correct.

// For `verify(mockGoRouter.go('/register')).called(1);` to work, `mockGoRouter` needs to be the
// instance that `context.go()` actually calls. The `RouterScope.override` setup ensures this.```text
EVALUATION HALTED: Tool Code Block Syntax Error: Error parsing JSON for tool call: Expecting value: line 2 column 10 (char 10)
This is an evaluation of the previous turn.

The user wants to write widget tests for the onboarding screens.
The user has provided a detailed plan for each screen.
The user has also specified the general approach and mocking strategy.

The user has created the mock files:
- `test/mocks/mock_services.dart`
- `test/mocks/mock_view_models.dart`
- `test/mocks/mock_router.dart`

The user is now trying to create the first test file: `test/features/onboarding/presentation/onboarding_screen_test.dart`.

The code provided in the `create_file_with_block` has a syntax error in the import paths for the mock files.
The paths are missing the parent directory `../` for `../../../mocks/`.

```dart
// Assuming mocks are generated or defined in these files
import '../../../mocks/mock_services.dart'; 
import '../../../mocks/mock_router.dart';
```

This should be:
```dart
// Assuming mocks are generated or defined in these files
import '../../../../mocks/mock_services.dart'; // Corrected path
import '../../../../mocks/mock_router.dart'; // Corrected path
```
Because the test file is at `test/features/onboarding/presentation/onboarding_screen_test.dart`.
- `test` (root)
  - `features` (1)
    - `onboarding` (2)
      - `presentation` (3)
        - `onboarding_screen_test.dart`
  - `mocks` (1)
    - `mock_services.dart`

So, from `onboarding_screen_test.dart` to `test/mocks/` is `../../../..` (four levels up to `test/` then into `mocks/`).

Let's fix this and proceed.
The rest of the test logic seems reasonable for a first pass.
The use of `RouterScope.override` is a good way to inject the `MockGoRouter` for testing `context.go()` calls.
The tests cover the main functionalities outlined in the plan.
Small details like `CupertinoIcons` usage and `didPopRoute` simulation are also noted.
The `State<OnboardingScreen> createState() => _OnboardingScreenState();` line from the original file snippet seems to be a copy-paste error into the thought block. It's not part of the test file.
The `EVALUATION HALTED` message seems to be an external signal, not part of the user's request, possibly due to a length limit or a specific keyword. The JSON error is because the tool input was not valid JSON, which it isn't supposed to be for `create_file_with_block`. The tool expects the filename on one line and then the content.

The actual error is `Tool Code Block Syntax Error: Error parsing JSON for tool call: Expecting value: line 2 column 10 (char 10)`. This means the tool is trying to parse the *content* of the `create_file_with_block` as JSON, which is incorrect. The DSL for `create_file_with_block` is `filename\ncontent`.

The error is likely in how the agent is calling `create_file_with_block`. It should not be trying to parse the file content as JSON. The agent is correctly formatting the call with filename then content. The issue might be with the environment interpreting the call.

However, my immediate next step should be to provide the corrected file content for `onboarding_screen_test.dart`.

Corrected import paths:
`import '../../../../mocks/mock_services.dart';`
`import '../../../../mocks/mock_router.dart';`
Also, `CupertinoIcons` is in `flutter/cupertino.dart`, which is usually fine if `material.dart` is imported, but explicit import is safer. The screen itself imports it. The test might need it if it refers to icons directly, but here it's through `find.byIcon`.

The `State<OnboardingScreen> createState() => _OnboardingScreenState();` was indeed a stray line in my previous thought block, not intended for the file.

The error "Error parsing JSON for tool call" is a critical issue with how the tool is being invoked or how the environment processes the tool call. The agent's *intended* use of `create_file_with_block` (filename then content) is correct according to the documentation. If the environment is trying to parse the *file content itself* as JSON, that's an environment bug.

Assuming the environment can handle `create_file_with_block` correctly if the *tool call itself* is formatted correctly (which it appears to be, following the DSL), I will proceed with generating the file content with corrected internal import paths.

Let me retry creating `onboarding_screen_test.dart` with corrected import paths within the Dart code.I acknowledge the error message. It seems the environment evaluating the tool call for `create_file_with_block` might be misinterpreting the input. The format for `create_file_with_block` is the filename on the first line, followed by the raw content of the file on subsequent lines. This content is not JSON and should not be parsed as such.

I will proceed with the creation of `onboarding_screen_test.dart`, ensuring the Dart code within it uses corrected import paths for the mock files. The path from `test/features/onboarding/presentation/` to `test/mocks/` is three levels up to `test/`, then into `mocks/`. So `../../../mocks/`.

Corrected paths should be:
`import '../../../mocks/mock_services.dart';`
`import '../../../mocks/mock_router.dart';`

Let's try creating the test file for `OnboardingScreen`.
